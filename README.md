# SpotifyEZ
## Overview
This project is designed to make creating and editing Spotify playlists easier. It has features to create a new playlist, edit existing playlists, make a playlist out of songs from an existing playlist, and add songs to a playlist using a Tinder-like "swiping" feature.

This was my group's final project for CS499 (Advanced Web Development) at Oregon State University
